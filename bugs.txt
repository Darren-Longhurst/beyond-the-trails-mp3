STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')

DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'

Why this works:
By explicitly setting DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE to Cloudinary, you ensure that any images uploaded to your blog go to the cloud. By setting STATICFILES_STORAGE to WhiteNoise, you ensure your CSS and JavaScript are served reliably from your own server without Cloudinary trying to "hijack" them, which was causing your FileNotFoundError.
